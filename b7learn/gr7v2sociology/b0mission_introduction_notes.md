# Introduction
## It Began with Two Insights
> Can leaders run more productive meetings without special facilitation skills?

Can people design more conscious institutions without special social engineering skills?

> In these situations I would be helping 50, 100, or more participants reach decisions and plan actions in a limited amount of time.

polymathProcess exists so we can help individuals and brands plan meaningful open source communities in a limited amount of time.

> Specific structures made more productive behavior natural.

polymathProcess uses the set structure of 369API to improve communication and productivity within and between communities.

> My insight came when I realized that some techniques of these large group methods could improve smaller, "regular" meetings led by someone without specific facilitation training.

Our hypothesis comes when we questioned if the techniques that allow individuals who run "regular" meetings without facilitation training can be applied to empower individuals to lead our institutions.

> The usual approach to committee meetings using a formal room set-up and discussion process had led to difficult exchanges with town members.

How does "business as usual" currently work for institutions?

> I recommended that we move the sessions to more flexible spaces and use a structure that supported dialogue and constructive feedback.

polymathProcess creates one on one sessions that support censor free dialogue and constructive feedback.

> I realized that people may not recognize or even see the structures that shape meeting behaviors and outcomes.

polymathProcess realized that people don't recognize or even see the institutional structures that directly influence our lives.

> To use structure to create better meetings, leaders must first be more aware of the structural choices they have for the meetings to run.

To design better institutions, people need to be more aware of how of the thought forms we use for institutions to run.
