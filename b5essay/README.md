Communities are subconsciously programmed for war:
- We
- Are
- Right

We ask "Are We Right?" to (1) stay honest about the fact that none of us know what's going on and (2) to create experiments that use music and memes to reprogram/remix Humanity's subconscious (our institutions).

Make...AWR, not WAR ðŸ˜£
