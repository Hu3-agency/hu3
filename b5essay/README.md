Communities are subconsciously programmed for war:
- We
- Are
- Right

We ask "Are We Right?" to see (1) stay honest about the fact that none of us know what's going on and (2) see what'll happen if we reprogram/remix Humanity's subconscious (our institutions) with music and memes.

Make...AWR, not WAR ðŸ˜£
