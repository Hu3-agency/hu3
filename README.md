# huStory: We're All Right
huStory is a story game about Earth, our collective ego death, and what it means to creatively engineer a new open source identity for The Planet. There's no limit to how many people can play, and the game lasts as long as humans do.

_Let's break this down._

## Story Game  
"Story games are a structured way for people to tell stories together. The rules of the game help players invent fiction and share experiences that would be hard to craft from a blank page. In huStory, all players have equal authority and a shared stake in the narrative. By giving more of yourself, you'll get more from the game." - Dialect: A Game About Language and How it Dies  
  
## LongPlay (universe)
In huStory, you'll define and explore a parallel universe based on what we do in our own reality. It's called a LongPlay (LP). In your LP, every human being exists as part of a single entity called "hu3" that's responsible for guiding the universe in a new direction using music and memes. Each LP's success rests on the ability of each player to explore their creative interests. As players transform their realities, they get to see their LPs mirror their collective growth.  
  
## Meaning (meme-ing?) Making  
You'll write your LongPlay's story by grouping music and memes to create what we call a mixtapeMythology. Over the course of the game, you'll create different content clusters (beatDrops) that define your LPs values, provide new perspectives of our reality, and how we can maturely respond to help The Planet achieve decentralized self mastery. You will use the content you create to explore yourself and advance the mythology of the LongPlay. Each time a new beat is added, the LP grows, and our shared reality evolves.  
  
huStory's impact stems from allowing slow growth to take place across a decentralized network of players all working towards a shared vision. The more we play, the more the game will transform...giving us an ever expanding system that no one person can ever fully explore. EpicPlaylists (EPs) represent different time periods in your LP, and just like in our reality, as time changes, so will your LP. Ultimately, you'll come to realize that every person has a direct impact on what The Planet does from now on. How will you help tell our story?  
  
## Players Welcome
This is a new type of roleplaying game, because we are the actual characters. Our actions in the game will have a direct impact on our day to day lives. If you're excited about creating a New Earth, you've come to the right place. Don't worry about trying to understand all the rules. You'll learn how all this works by listening to music you love and exploring things that interest you.
