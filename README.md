# LP0_polymathProcess
## What is huStory?
_huStory: We're All Right_ is an open source collection of story games about The Planet, our history (ego), and the memes that shape our reality. LP0_polymathProcess is huStory's genesis LongPlay that develops the default musical language system used by other games in the series. There's no player limit, and the game runs until people stop contributing.

_Let's clarify some of this..._

### What's a Story Game?  
Story games make it easy for people to create collaborative mythologies. The game structure helps players construct meaningful narratives that would have been difficult to create otherwise. Every person has a shared stake in the narrative. 

This concept allows huStory to build a network of LongPlays that use shared story outlines so communities can exchange value and view their ideas from different perspectives. Note: If you add to huStory in any way, you're officially one of its co-creators.
  
### What's a LongPlay?
In huStory, you'll define and explore a parallel universe based on what we do in our own reality. It's called a LongPlay (LP). In your LP, every human being exists as part of a single entity called "hu3" that's responsible for guiding the universe in a new direction using music and memes. Each LP's success rests on the ability of each player to explore their creative interests. As players transform their realities, they get to see their LPs mirror their collective growth.




Players use polymathProcess to use book quotes to define the values of their avatar and 




  
### Meaning (meme-ing?) Making  
You'll write your LongPlay's story by grouping music and memes to create what we call a mixtapeMythology. Over the course of the game, you'll create different content clusters (beatDrops) that define your LPs values, provide new perspectives of our reality, and how we can maturely respond to help The Planet achieve decentralized self mastery. You will use the content you create to explore yourself and advance the mythology of the LongPlay. Each time a new beat is added, the LP grows, and our shared reality evolves.  
  
huStory's impact stems from allowing slow growth to take place across a decentralized network of players all working towards a shared vision. The more we play, the more the game will transform...giving us an ever expanding system that no one person can ever fully explore. EpicPlaylists (EPs) represent different time periods in your LP, and just like in our reality, as time changes, so will your LP. Ultimately, you'll come to realize that every person has a direct impact on what The Planet does from now on. How will you help tell our story?  
  
### Players Welcome
This is a new type of roleplaying game, because we are the actual characters. Our actions in the game will have a direct impact on our day to day lives. If you're excited about creating a New Earth, you've come to the right place. Don't worry about trying to understand all the rules. You'll learn how all this works by listening to music you love and exploring things that interest you.
