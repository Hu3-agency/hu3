"It really is high time that, in many ways, the institution of the fool was reintroduced" - Alan Watts

Where humans build mythologies
People and brands build, ship, and maintain their LongPlays with the polymathProcess. The most important subcultural development platform in our entire imaginations.

Give your creative experiments a home in the cloud
Grow and coordinate an opensource community around your ideas. We're not too keen on building brand new apps, so for now, we're using GitHub to tap into it's +40m large opensource community.

Don't Reinvent the Wheel
Your LongPlay is created in a similar fashion to cell division in our bodies. An existing LongPlay is used to help you easily structure your project before breaking off into your own universe. Choose from our growing network of LPs to launch from a project that resonates with you.

"More hands make the work go faster" - Wayne, Letterkenny
Stronger ideas start with symbiosis --- build relationships around common interests and music. Give and receive support in our connected network of LPs to bring your project to life faster. 




polymathProcess is an open-source protocol that uses music playlists and memes to create self-sovereign subcultures. Any person or brand can clone this repository to outline a decentralized strategy that empowers your community to influence the vision and strategy of your project. Below, we'll point you to a couple of different wikis to learn more about how to get started!

This is a flexible framework that's meant to be available to anyone with an idea. Which of these best describes you?
- I have a lot of ideas but don't know how to turn them into a real brand/project
- I have an existing brand/peoject but want to grow a more passionate community
- I have a passionate community and am ready to empower them to creatively tell our story

(All of these link to the same wiki that explains the process)
- Wiki is onboarding flow
- Learn about groove0 and beat0quote - walk them through the steps of suggesting a book and getting it designed and shared on our instagram by the community (shows them how their future repository can operate)
- Have them walk through an example of each groove/beat to help them create a content strategy
- After 9 steps, they'll have a rough outline for their content strategy
- Walk them through how to fork the repository, fill in their own info, and start contributing to their project - announce their project on our social media to help them build a freelance community

(above will be the tl;dr with a bunch of quick links to get people started - assuming if they're on github that they're ready to get to work)

(below will be an intro to hu3agency's wiki. the end of it will link to the rest of the wiki that explains the broader vision of what we're working on)

This will be where we lay out the LongPlay's values encoded from the figma file. This will be the more narrative form. 
- Song
- Groove/Verse
- Universe Explination
- huniverse/myth explination
- Call to action with links to other files (see other examples of this)

Direct people to the Wiki to learn more.
