# b0mission/oS
b0mission is an ourStory Framework for using music & book quotes to define the language & mission for any open source community. The architecture of b0mission/oS aims to be accessible to any community that wants to add depth and context to their shared vision. b0mission provides the foundation for the other buildig blocks from the ourStory Protocol. After completing the b0mission equation, you'll be on your way to creating a self-soverign ecosystem for your open source project.
## Hash Function
For beats 0 through 8, the ourStory Protocol uses SHA-256 Hash functions to encode the DNA of your open source community. The b0mission hash function takes three variables: `gr0v0song`, `gr0v1ego`, `gr0v2biomimicry`, and `gr0v3willpower`. Each of these will be defined below.
```
let b0mission = SHA256(gr0ourSource);

let gr0ourSource = {
  gr0v0song: "SONG_NAME by ARTIST",
  gr0v1ego:  "BOOK_TITLE by AUTHOR",
  gr0v2biomimicry: "BOOK_TITLE by AUTHOR",
  gr0v3willpower: "BOOK_TITLE by AUTHOR"
};
```
## What is huStory?
_huStory: We're All Right_ is an open source collection of projects for The Planet, our ego, and the memes that shape our reality. polymathProcess is huStory's genesis LongPlay that develops the memetic outline that makes it easier for communities to collaborate while transforming any project into an original story game that engages a broad community. There's no player limit, and the projects run until people stop contributing.

_Let's clarify some of this..._

### What's a Story Game?  
Story games make it easy for people to create collaborative mythologies. The game structure helps players construct meaningful narratives that would have been difficult to create otherwise. Every person has a shared stake in the narrative. 

This concept allows huStory to build a network of LongPlays that use shared story outlines so communities can exchange value and view their ideas from different perspectives. Note: If you add to huStory in any way, you're officially one of its co-creators.
  
### What's a LongPlay?
A LongPlay can be thought of as a portfolio for the different decentralized projects a community creates. Each LP is ultimately a representation of each players exploration of their own creative interests. As players transform their realities, they get to see their LPs mirror their collective growth.

In huStory, each LP represents a Kalpavriksha Tree in the expanding forest gardens we grow with out imaginations. We use GitHub to allow people to share book quotes that define the water, soil, and avatars that support each LPs growth and maturity.

### Memes and Meaning 
People add to huStory by sharing memes and music. As the game develops, the will branch into unexpected storylines that nobody will be able to predict, so we'll always have new ways to explore our minds, experiment with new ideas, and propose new ways for us to design society.
  
huStory's impact stems from allowing slow growth to take place across a distributed network of players all contributing to our open source vision for The Planet. How will you help tell our story?  
  
### Define Your Reality
This is a new type of roleplaying game, because people are free to add value to the ecosystem by explore new or old interests. huStory is a perfect way to experiment with potential new income streams in an extremely forgiving and supporting community. 

Don't worry about trying to understand all the rules. You'll learn more and more as you work through the steps. Let's get you started with the first step in the game: Defining the Source of Your LongPlay (link to #beat0quote issue form)
